## Hi There!

I am Spandan. I will begin with a formal introduction. I am a MSc student of Physics at NISER, Bhubaneswar, India, who is working (or trying to work) on nanoscale devices, and planning to study Quantum Transport phenomena. I am currently working on getting a procedure ready to make and test devices made up of materials with structures analogous to what we have already seen in black-phosphorus. That aside, while I am doing that, I plan to go through some proper theory in Mesoscopic Physics (starting from some basic stuff) and document it here as I go around learning things that I haven't seen or head of before.

That being said, I am human, and I will make mistakes along the way. If any of you readers find anything that seems off, feel free to email me at [my public email address](mailto:surelynottrue@gmail.com) as and when you wish. I appreciate new ways to look at things and criticism of all sorts.

## The Plan

The plan here is simple. I pick a topic, read it through thoroughly and try to explain it as simply as I can, because I know that I have understood a concept only if I can explain it to other people who have some basic idea of what I am talking about. At the same time, I want to make sure that I understand what I have wanted to say when I eventually forget a concept and feel the need to look back. I expect this to be a tedious but a welcome exercise given that it will help multiple people, including me at the same time.

I will be following [Sergey Frolov's](https://www.youtube.com/c/SergeyFrolovPhysics/videos) YouTube lectures along with the three books that I list below. I have gone through parts of them while attending the course at my college, taken by [Professor Colin Benjamin](https://www.niser.ac.in/users/colin). I highly recommend having a look them if you've got some time at hand. They are:

- [Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/electronic-transport-in-mesoscopic-systems/1E55DEF5978AA7B843FF70337C220D8B) By Supriyo Dutta
- [Topological Insulators - Dirac Equation in Condensed Matters](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642328572) By Shun-Qing Shen
- [Quantum Transport: Introduction to Nanoscience](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/Quantum_Transport.html?id=YNr4OcCExUcC&redir_esc=y) By Yuli Nazarov and Yaroslav Blanter

I will start with some concepts that I had not covered in my coursework, and some of the things that I find are hard to understand. I can then go back to revising some of the things that I might have forgotten.

## Schedule

I will have no particular schedule for posts and I will post as soon as I am done with a major chunk of the topic. I will continue writing the blog till I have had a spark for a novel idea maybe, and will keep most of what I say well referenced and open source. 

See you in the next post!
